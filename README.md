The system is deployed on 4 containers controlled via The Docker Compose subsystem.
The Docker Compose working directory consists of 4 parts: 
    - postgres;
    - redis;
    - nginx;
    - web.

The file docker-compose.yml describes the architecture of the system.
Containers interconnect each other via local host network.
Each part has 'log', 'init' and some of them 'data' directories inside: 
    - 'init' is intended for initial scripts and configuration files;
    - 'log' contains log files generated by working containers (Could be used for Elastic stack in the next versions);
    - 'data' for the data generated by the working containers.

The SystemD is used for managing Docker compose subsystem.
